# Angular Redux Apollo example

A working integration of an Apollo client store with an existing Redux store 
([ng2-redux](https://github.com/angular-redux/ng2-redux)). Preconfigured to 
pull from a public GraphQL endpoint with sample data.

Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Then open 
[Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) to inspect the store
state: the `apollo` state should show up alongside `elephants` and `lions`.

Original code adapted from [example-app](https://github.com/angular-redux/example-app/).
